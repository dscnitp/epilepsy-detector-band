# Epilepsy-Band-Detector🧬🩺


## Problems Addressed:
1- Limiting Siezures and sudden attacks of epilepsy by monitoring daily schedule.</br>

2- A probabilistic limitation in sudden heart attacks and fainting due to low BP.</br>

3- Monitoring of daily life of people thus reducing risks and medical non-adherence.</br>


## Overview:👓

Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal,</br>
causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. </br>
Anyone can develop epilepsy. 😟</br>
Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.</br>
Missed medication, lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, and menstruation are some of the most common triggers, but there are many more. </br>
Flashing lights can cause seizures in some people</br>
Apart from the above High level of strenuous exercise may cause seizures and 🚴‍♂️🤸‍♀️</br>
most importantly may cause heart attack in old patients and may also cause the weak or sick to faint. </br>
Apart from this, there are many daily situations which may cause us to find ourselves in medically difficult situation.</br>
</br>
In a life as busy and strenous as today's, Health has become a secondary issue for us and major concern for society.</br>
In such a situation what is impotant is to efficiently monitor and routine our life without any interfernce in daily routine.</br>
</br>
While the above mentioned mishapenings can occur due to many reasons apart from the ones mentioned above-</br>
the most common phenomenon in all mentioned situations is the sudden increase or decrease in heartbeat rate.🩺 </br>
</br>
We will expoilting this in our project, and along with several other monitorng factors we will keep the heartbeat rate as a major one.</br>
The final output will be a wrist band which will help montior and control and thus routine evry activity.</br>


## Goals: 🎡

1 - For initial state we aim to reduce the chance of seizures in epilesy paitients by measuring their daily activities and guiding them accordingly</br>

2 - We also aim to take into account a larger group and help the large part of population and help them lead a life that does not increase the risk of disease in thier life.</br>


## Scalability (targeted category of people that will benefit from this):

The people targetted are not only the ones suffering from epiplesy, though they are the main target,</br>
our idea is for all those busy and old people who are not able to routine and control their life in a medically feasable way.</br>
Apart from monitoring, since this is also acting as a warning system, it can be said a `must have for everyone.`</br>


## Tech Stacks Required:

1- Hardware(Raspberry pi, heart-beat sensor, accelerometer, DS3231..etc)</br>
2- ML</br>

## Limitations:
 
1- To make it finally usable we will have to use microcontroller that can be embedded in a wrist band, whichis quite complex to work with eg-MX6ULL

2- Experimenting Stage will be difficult.

## Roadmap Overview:

First time interval - 2-3 months  - A working model with basics ready. ⏳</br>

Second time interval - 4 months - complete project with wrist band ready⌛</br> 

## Approximate count of contributors required: 
  
  `5-6 People.` 👨🧑👩👧👦🧒
